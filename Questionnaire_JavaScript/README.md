## JavaScript Questionnaire

### 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is dynamically typed, multi-paradigm, high-level language that allows us to write applications not only for the browser but thanks to Node.js we can create programs that run on every machine. Here is an overview of the language.

### 2. What is JavaScript engine?

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language. Different browsers use different engines, for example: 
- Chrome uses **V8**
- Firefox uses **SpiderMonkey**
- Safari uses **JavaScriptCore**

These engines parse, compile, and run JavaScript code efficiently.

### 3. What is Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.
