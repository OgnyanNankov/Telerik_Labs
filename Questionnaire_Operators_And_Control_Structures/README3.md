## Operators and Control Structures

### 1. What are operators? How are they used?

JavaScript operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. They can be categorised into several types, including arithmetic (e.g., +, -, *, /), comparison (e.g., ==, != , >, <), logical (e.g., &&, ||, !), and assignment (e.g., =, +=, -=) operators.

### 2. What are if-else statements? 

In programming, if-else statements are used to make decisions based on specific conditions. For example, in JavaScript, the if-else statement allows the program to execute certain code if a condition is true, and another set of code if the condition is false.

### 2. What is are switch statements? 

A JavaScript switch statement is used to execute different blocks of code depending on different conditions. It is similar to an if-else statement, but it checks for multiple conditions.

### 2. How do we compare variables? Strict (===) vs non-strict comparison (==). 

The == operator performs a loose equality comparison that performs type coercion if necessary to make the comparison possible. The === operator, on the other hand, performs a strict equality comparison that does not perform type coercion and requires the operands to have the same type (as well as the same value).
