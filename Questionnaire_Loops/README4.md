## Loops

### 1. What are loops and why are they used?

Loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a particular condition is met. There are three types of loops in most programming languages: for , while , and do-while loops. The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

### 2. What are if-else statements? 

- The for Loop: The for Loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript. It allows us to execute a block of code a specified number of times
- The do...while Loop: he do...while Loop is similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: the condition is evaluated after the code block has been executed.
This means that the code block will always execute at least once, regardless of the condition
- The while Loop: The while A loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is similar to the do...while loop, but the condition is evaluated before the code block is executed.
